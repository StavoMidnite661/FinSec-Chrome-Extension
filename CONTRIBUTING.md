# We see you. Welcome.

This isn't just an open-source project; it's the start of a movement. If you're reading this, you are not just a potential contributorâ€”you are a potential pioneer. You see the future of a decentralized web, and we want to build it with you.

## The Digital Handshake

Before you write a single line of code or file a single issue, we want to meet you. We believe that great communities are built on personal connections, not just pull requests.

**Here is our handshake:**

1.  Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository.
2.  Create a **New Issue** with the title: `[Introduction] Your Name / Your Alias`.
3.  In the body, tell us a little about yourself. What excites you about this project? What is your vision for the future of Web3? There are no wrong answers.

This is our way of saying, "We see you, and we're thrilled you're here."

## Ways to Contribute

Once you've made your introduction, there are many ways to help build the future:

*   **Share the Vision:** Talk about the project. The bigger our community, the faster we can revolutionize the web.
*   **Report Bugs:** If you find something broken in the extension, opening a detailed issue is one of the most helpful things you can do.
*   **Suggest Features:** Have an idea for how to make the gateway even better? Let's discuss it.
*   **Write Code:** If you're ready to contribute code, please look for issues tagged `help-wanted` or propose your own changes. All pull requests will be reviewed to maintain the security and integrity of the project.

## Our Commitment

We are committed to fostering an open, welcoming, and respectful community. We expect all contributors to adhere to a code of conduct that ensures everyone feels valued and safe.

Let's build the future, together.
