# Chrome Extension Restructure Status

## Current Status
- Initial restructure script executed
- Push succeeded but encountered errors
- Patches provided but not yet verified

## Issues Encountered
1. Move-Item write errors:
   - SRC -> src path conflicts
   - Some items already in destination
2. Move-Item invalid parameter error with -Recurse
3. manifest.json modification failures

## Applied Patches
1. ✨ Safer move-from-SRC logic
2. ✨ Robust manifest.json update procedure

## Verification Steps
- [X] Run inspection commands:
  ```powershell
  git status --porcelain
  git log -1 --pretty=oneline
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse .\src | Select-Object FullName
  git --no-pager diff --name-only -- manifest.json manifest.json.bak
  git ls-files '*client_secret*'
  ```

## Next Steps
1. Apply patches to restructure_and_push.ps1
2. Test without -Push flag
3. Verify file structure and manifest
4. Run with -Push flag if verification passes

## Awaiting
- Confirmation of patch application
- Verification of file structure

## Notes
- Keep this file updated with progress
- Document any new issues encountered
- Track verification results

## Inspection Report & Analysis

**1. Summary of Findings:**

The repository has been partially restructured. Key source files are now located in the `src` directory. However, the `restructure_and_push.ps1` script is still failing to correctly modify the `manifest.json` file. The git repository is otherwise in a clean state, with no tracked client secrets.

**2. Detailed Inspection Results:**

*   **Git Status:**
    *   **Command:** `git status --porcelain`
    *   **Output:**
        ```
         M scripts/restructure_and_push.ps1
         M scripts/tasks.md
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** This output is expected. It confirms that our working files, the script itself and this task document, have been modified.

*   **Last Commit:**
    *   **Command:** `git log -1 --pretty=oneline`
    *   **Output:** `6cb005d... chore: restructure src, update manifest paths, add .gitignore`
    *   **Analysis:** This confirms that the last successful git operation was the commit made by a previous execution of the `restructure_and_push.ps1` script.

*   **Source Directory Structure:**
    *   **Command:** `Get-ChildItem -Recurse .\src | Select-Object FullName`
    *   **Analysis:** The `src` directory is correctly populated with the extension's source files, organized into `background`, `content`, and `popup` subdirectories. This part of the restructuring was successful.

*   **Manifest Backup Comparison:**
    *   **Command:** `git --no-pager diff --name-only -- manifest.json manifest.json.bak`
    *   **Output:** (empty)
    *   **Analysis:** The lack of difference between `manifest.json` and its backup (`manifest.json.bak`) indicates that the script failed to apply its intended modifications to the manifest file during the last execution.

*   **Client Secret Files:**
    *   **Command:** `git ls-files '*client_secret*'`
    *   **Output:** (empty)
    *   **Analysis:** This is a positive result. It confirms that no sensitive client secret files are being tracked by git, which adheres to security best practices.

**3. Conclusion & Recommended Next Step:**

The primary obstacle is the failure of the `restructure_and_push.ps1` script to correctly update the `manifest.json` file. All other operations seem to be performing as expected.

I recommend we now focus exclusively on fixing the manifest update logic within the script. Once this is resolved, we can proceed with a final, clean execution of the script.

## Verification Results ✅
- Repository state is clean
- Source files properly moved to src directory
- No sensitive files exposed
- manifest.json needs attention

## Critical Next Actions
1. Backup manifest.json:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item manifest.json manifest.json.bak -Force
   ```

2. Apply manifest.json patch:
   ```powershell
   # Verify manifest.json structure first
   Get-Content manifest.json | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
   ```

3. Test restructure script:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   .\scripts\restructure_and_push.ps1    # WITHOUT -Push flag
   ```

## Expected Changes
- manifest.json should update with correct src/ paths
- No additional file moves should occur
- Script should complete without errors

## Success Criteria
- [ ] manifest.json contains correct src/ paths
- [ ] No errors in script execution
- [ ] No unexpected file movements
- [ ] Clean git status after test

## Progress Log
[Current] - Inspection complete, ready for manifest.json update

## CLI Commands (Execute in Order)

1. Backup manifest:
```powershell
Copy-Item manifest.json manifest.json.bak -Force
```

2. Verify manifest structure:
```powershell
Get-Content manifest.json | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

3. Run test restructure:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
.\scripts\restructure_and_push.ps1
```

4. Verify changes:
```powershell
git status --porcelain
Get-Content manifest.json | ConvertFrom-Json | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
```

## Quick Verification Checklist
- [ ] manifest.json backup created
- [ ] restructure script completed without errors
- [ ] manifest.json contains correct src/ paths
- [ ] Clean git status
