# Smart Contract Security Audit Plan

## 1. Introduction & Objectives

This document outlines the plan for conducting a formal, independent security audit of the `SOVRCreditBridgePOS.sol` smart contract.

**Primary Objectives:**
*   Identify and remediate any potential security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to re-entrancy, integer overflow/underflow, access control issues, and economic exploits.
*   Verify that the contract's logic correctly and securely implements the intended business requirements as defined in `smart-contract-interface.md`.
*   Ensure the contract adheres to current best practices for Solidity development and security, with a focus on both direct exploits and subtle economic/logic flaws.
*   Provide a high degree of assurance to stakeholders, partners, and users regarding the security and integrity of the SOVR payment system.
*   Obtain a public audit report that can be shared to build trust and transparency.

## 2. Scope of the Audit

### In Scope:
*   The final, perfected Solidity code for `SOVRCreditBridgePOS.sol`.
*   All inherited contracts from the OpenZeppelin library. The exact versions used will be specified via the project's lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`).
*   The on-chain interactions and state changes resulting from calling all public and external functions.
*   The correctness of event emissions.

### Out of Scope:
*   All off-chain components, including the Chrome Extension, Secure Backend Service, Web3 Gateway, and TigerBeetle.
*   The security of the private keys used by the contract owner and relayer.
*   The underlying blockchain protocol's security.

## 3. Pre-Audit Preparation

Before engaging with an audit firm, the internal engineering team will complete the following:

1.  **Code Freeze:** The `SOVRCreditBridgePOS.sol` contract code will be frozen. No further functional changes will be made to the version submitted for audit.
2.  **Comprehensive Documentation:** A complete documentation package will be prepared, including:
    *   This audit plan.
    *   All architectural documents (`smart-contract-interface.md`, `backend-sequence-diagram.md`).
    *   Detailed NatSpec comments for all functions, events, and state variables in the code.
3.  **Complete Test Suite:** A comprehensive test suite (Hardhat/Foundry) will be developed, achieving 100% line and branch coverage. The test suite will be shared with the auditors.
4.  **Static Analysis:** The code will be run through static analysis tools like Slither and MythX, and all identified high/medium-severity issues will be addressed.
5.  **Fuzz Testing:** The contract will be subjected to fuzz testing using tools like Foundry's built-in fuzzer or Echidna to uncover unexpected edge cases and state machine vulnerabilities that deterministic tests might miss.

## 4. Auditor Selection Criteria

We will select one or more reputable blockchain security firms based on the following criteria:
*   Proven track record of auditing high-value DeFi and financial smart contracts.
*   Deep expertise in Solidity, the EVM, and common attack vectors.
*   Positive reputation within the Web3 security community.
*   Transparent and collaborative audit process.

## 5. Audit Process

1.  **Kickoff:** A kickoff meeting will be held with the audit team to review the documentation, discuss the architecture, and answer any initial questions.
2.  **Independent Review:** The audit firm will conduct a thorough manual and automated review of the code.
3.  **Critical Findings Protocol:** A secure, real-time communication channel (e.g., Signal) will be established for the immediate reporting of any critical vulnerabilities. An internal rapid response will be triggered upon such a notification.
4.  **Interim Report:** An interim report will be provided, detailing any initial findings. Our team will review and begin working on remediations.
5.  **Final Report:** The audit firm will deliver a final, detailed report classifying all findings by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational).
6.  **Remediation:** Our team will address all identified issues, providing detailed explanations for each fix.
7.  **Verification:** The audit firm will review our remediations to confirm that the vulnerabilities have been properly resolved.

## 6. Post-Audit Actions

*   **Final Report Publication:** The final, verified audit report will be made public to ensure transparency and build user trust.
*   **Deployment:** Only after a successful audit with all critical/high-severity issues resolved will the contract be deployed to a production mainnet.
*   **Bug Bounty Program:** Consideration will be given to establishing a post-launch bug bounty program to encourage ongoing security research by the community.
*   **Auditor Retainer:** Consideration will be given to retaining the audit firm for a short period post-deployment for immediate consultation on any unforeseen issues or to re-verify minor hotfixes if absolutely necessary.
